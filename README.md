Beyond web server in REXX with CGI capabilities and demo cgis for monitoring z/VM

Here is an example of what this web server can do with just a few commands as a z/VM service machine:

Welcome to the z/VM Mainframe!

This website is helps me monitor my z/VM mainframe. On this system I run the following operating systems as guest machines:

 	z/OS 2.2
	z/OS 2.3

Some of these guest machines have up to 12GB of storage assigned to them. Som e others only 16 megabytes. 

What do I do on this mainframe?

Here are some of the activities going on here:

HLASM, REXX and PL/I programming under z/VM and z/OS 
zLinux porting of parity blockchain software
performance benchmarking
time sharing use for about 60 users


What hardware is this mainframe running on?

This server is running inside an IBM z/PDT mainframe, type 1090, on top of a Lenovo Cube c730 computer. The advantage of a gaming computer is quick processors, fast ram, and tons of very fast NVME and SSD disks. < /p>

This Lenovo computer has 64GB of RAM, an i7 CPU, and about 20TB of a mix of NVME, SSD, and spinning disks (mostly for backup)&nb sp;
